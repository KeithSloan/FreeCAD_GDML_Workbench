## Installable FreeCAD Python Workbench


FreeCAD's python Importer & Exporter for GDML files.


## Installation 

Install by use of FreeCAD Addon Manager

Needs lxml which should be installed as part of FreeCAD

   * FreeCAD_0.19.19424 and above.
   * FreeCAD_0.19.19409_x64_Conda_Py3QT5-WinVS2015.7z and above.
   
## FreeCAD version 0.18

There are known problems with FreeCAD 0.18 it is recommended that you use FreeCAD 0.19 as above.
( Note: You can install both versions 0.18 & 0.19 and still use 0.18 for non GDML related work )   
   
## No module named 'lxml'

If you get an error message No module named 'lxml' then on Linux you can diagnose as follows.

To check path FreeCAD uses from a command line.

    freecad -c
    import sys
    print(sys.path)
    
To check lxml correctly installed for freecad

    freecad -c
    import lxml
    from lxml import etree
    print(etree.LXML_VERSION)
    
 On linux to install lxml to a specific directory
 
    pip3 install lxml -t <directory>
    
   
## Details of GDML

For more information on GDML see

[GDML User Guide](http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/framework/GDML/doc/GDMLmanual.pdf)

[GDML Solids](http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Detector/Geometry/geomSolids.html)

## Usage

### GDML Solids

GDML Solids are implemented as FreeCAD Python Objects and have the same properties as defined by GDML. By selecting an Object the properties can be changed via the FreeCAD properties windows and the resulting changes displayed.

### Create a new GDML design

1. Start FreeCAD
2. Select the **GDML workbench** from the workbench dropdown menu.
3. Select **File > New**  
   Result: This will load the default GDML File with materials and creates a World Volume.  
4. Create `1-n Volumes` in the World Volume by
   * Click on the Part icon (image: yellow blockish icon)
   * Drag the created **Part** to the World Volume in the **Tree** window
   * **Part** maybe renamed via right click context menu  
5. Create GDML Solids by:  
   * Clicking on the corresponding icon of the workbench.
   * Drag the GDML object to the appropriate **Part** again via the **Tree** window
   * You can then change the attributes by selecting the GDMLObject in the **Tree** window then changing the properties in the **Property View**
      
  So a valid structure for a GDML file is:  
   * Single World Volume (Part)
   * A number of Volumes (Parts) under the World Volume
   * A number of GDML Objects can exist in one Part ( GDML Logical Volume)
 
6. To Export to GDML
    1. Select the 'World' Volume ( Default Name WorldVol )
    2. File export
    3. Select filetype as GDML ( Bottom Box of **Export file** window)
    4. Select Destination and file name with **GDML** as file extension 

**Important Notes:**  
* Opening a new file when the GDML workbench is active will load a Default file.
* The Default file is defined in `GDML/Mod/Resources/Default.gdml`.
* If a material is selected in 'Labels & Attributes window at the time a new GDML objects is created
  then this will set the material of the new Object. If no material is selected the objects material is set to the
  first material in the Defaults file i.e. `SSteel0x56070ee87d10`
  
## GDML Object Creation

Upon switching to the GDML workbench, one will notice a number of icons that become available on the Workbench bar.

* Clicking on one the icons will create a GDML object.

  If at the time a material is selected e.g. in the 'Labels & Attributes' window,
  then the object will be created with that material, otherwise the material will be set to the first material in the list.
  
* It should then be dragged to the appropriate __Part__ (GDML Logical Volume)
* In neccessary, once can then edit the properties via the properties window. The parameters should be the same as in the [GDML user guide]().  
* If the Object is part of a Boolean you will have to use the **recompute** facility of FreeCAD to see the change to the Boolean. This can be achieved through the right clicking on the context menu or clicking the **Recompute** icon in the toolbar.

### GDML Objects Currently Supported for creation via the GUI are

_Short decription_

Given a lot more solids are supported for import, it is not too difficult to add more,
so if you feel you need a particular solid to be added please contact me.

## GDML Tessellated Objects

The following icons are available for Tessellated operations

### T - Tessellate

If the selected FreeCAD object has a Shape then a GDML Tesselated Object is created by using the Meshing
Workbench default options. If a material is also selected this will determine the GDML material of the
created GDML Tessellated Object

### M 2 T - Mesh 2 Tessellate

If the selected FreeCAD object is a mesh then a GDML Tessellated Object is created. Again if a material is
also selected then this will set the GDML material of the GDML Tessellated Object.

   1) FreeCAD Supports a large number of mesh file formats including stl, ply, etc
      so **Mesh 2 Tessellate** allows these to be converted to a GDML Tessellate object
      
   2) The Mesh Workbench offers a range of meshing facilites with options ( Meshes | create mesh from Shape )
   
      * Standard
      * Mefisto
      * Netgen
      * Gmsh ( Requires FreeCAD 0.19+ )
      
      So having created a mesh using the Mesh workbench, one can then switch to the GDML Workbench to
      create GDML Tessellated objects from these.

## GDML Import

A lot more GDML solids are supported for import. For example all Solids
used by the CERN Alice.gdml are defined.

On import or open of a GDML file a Dialog box will open with two options

- Import
- Scan Vol

Import will do a straight import of GDML Objects.

Scan Vol is for large files like Alice.GDML that take far too long to process. 

Volumes are only processed to a limit depth i.e. volume names are determined but not processed
For unprocessed volume the names are preceded by **`NOT_Expanded`** so an example volume name would be: `NOT_Expanded_<VolumeName>`


#### Expansion of Scanned Volume

Unexpanded Volumes can be expanded by:  
1. Switching to the GDML workbench.
2. Selecting a volume in the **_labels & attributes_** window
3. Clicking on the experimental Expand Volume icon **'E'**

On opening of a GDML file the appropriate FreeCAD implemented python Object is created for each solid

## Viewing Volumes

The first icon on the workbench bar is different. If you select a object by one of the following methods  

1. A volume via the Combo view - Model - Labels & Attributes.

   Then click on the icon it will cycle the display mode of the selected Volume and all its children.
   The cycle is Solid -> WireFrame -> Not Displayed -> Solid

2. In the main display - select a face by <ctrl> <left mouse>
   
   Then click on the icon it will cycle the display mode of the selected object
   
## SampleFiles

[SampleFiles](SampleFiles/) directory contains some sample gdml files. 

One in particular is lhcbvelo.gdml. This file takes a LONG LONG time to import/open, over a minute on my system, but does eventually load. On my system I have to okay one wait. When it finally does display you will want to zoom in.

If when it is displayed you go down the Volumes tree to VelovVelo under the World volume then click on the toggle icon ( 1st GDML icon in the workbench) Again wait patiently and the display will change to wireframe. You can
then decend further down the Volumes tree, select one and again use the toggle icon and that volume and children will change to Solid. In this way various parts in different volumes can be examined.

## GDML Objects Exporter 

To export to GDML 

1. Select the 'world' Volume, should be first Part in Design
2. File export
3. Select GDML as filetype
4. Make sure file has GDML as file extension

### GDML Objects

GDMLObjects are output as straight GDML solids

### FreeCAD Objects

The following FreeCAD objects are output as GDML equivalents

| FreeCAD   |   GDML     |
| :-----:   |  :----:    |
| Cube      |  Box       |
| Cone      |  Cone      |
| Cylinder  |  Tube      |
| Sphere    |  Sphere    |

If not handled as above then objects shapes are checked  to see if planar,
if yes converts to Tessellated Solid with 3 or 4 vertex as appropriate.
If not creates a mesh and then a Tessellated solid with 3 vertex.

### Export of STEP version

Standard FreeCAD export facilities are available which includes the ability to create a STEP version

### Export/Import of Materials as an XML file.

If you select the Materials Group in Tree view and then use the standard FreeCAD export,
the export will create an xml file of the material definitions. You can then import this
file and the material definitions into a separate FreeCAD document. Note: The file extension
used should be xml NOT gdml

The Materials directory contains a number of Materials XML files including NIST Database
that can be imported.

### Constants / Isotopes / Elements / Materials

Importing a GDML will create FreeCAD objects for the above and export should
create the same GDML definitions as imported.

The Ability to change to change these maybe implemented in the future.
 
## Preferences

There is now an option to toggle `Printverbose` flag to reduce printing to the python console.

## New facility compound

### Use of `compound` to facilitate preperation for FEM analysis

#### Usage

* **Select** a volume/Part i.e. the first Part which is the GDML world volume and **click on** the `compound` icon **'C'**
  1. Creates an object named **Compound** under the selected Volume
  2. Create an FEM Analysis Object.
  3. All the materials of the objects in the Volume/Part/Compound are added to the Analysis Object.
  
* You can then switch to the **FEM Workbench** (_Finite Element Analysis_) and proceed with an analysis which would include:
  
  1. Double click on each of the materials to edit their properties
  2. From the FEM workbench select the Compound Object and click on the icon to create a Mesh.
  3. Rest would depend on what analysis and what solver it is intended to use.
  
  Also as an experiment: thermal parameters have been added to the `GDMLmaterial` object so these could
  be changed before creating a compound. One option to be would be to add elements to GDML files to enable
  loading and exporting, but then they would **NOT** be standard GDML files (maybe a different file extension?)  
  
## Standalone Utility

  In directory **Utils** You will find a python script **gdml2step.py** for creating a step file from a gdml file.
  
  syntax is
   
         python3 gdml2step.py <input gdml file> <output step file>
         
         The step file should be given a .step extension.
         
         In theory other file extension should produce a file of the appropriate type,
         e.g. iges, but this is untested.
